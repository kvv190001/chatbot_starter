<!-- TODO 10:
I have a chatbot interface layout, and I would like to create it as a
Thymeleaf template for my Spring Boot application. The layout includes the following elements:

Header:
 A title at the top, "AJSD Chatbot."

Left Panel:
    A scrollable section labeled "Our conversation" that shows messages exchanged
    between the chatbot and the user.
    Each message should be styled distinctly (e.g., "Chatbot says" and "You requested").
    Only this section should scroll, on overflow. Max height is 350px

Right Panel:
    A section titled "About AJSD Chatbot" with descriptive text about the chatbot,
    including instructions for interacting with it like display :
     "1. type 'teach' to begin
     2. type 'clear' to reset
     3.  type 'another country name or put a space after the country name' when
         'a valid country name is not understood'.
     4. try using the rest or use the term 'teach' to try from beginning
    "

Bottom Panel:
    An input field where the user can type their query or response to the chatbot.
    A button labeled "Ask Chatbot" to send the query.

Footer:
    A disclaimer text at the bottom stating: "By using this chatbot,
    you indemnify the creators from all legal action. Please remember that AJSD Chatbot can make mistakes."

The color scheme includes a light background with a slightly darker panel on the left and right
for visual distinction.

Please generate a Thymeleaf template here (index.html) for this layout,
including the appropriate CSS for styling.

Ensure the left panel is scrollable,
and the input field and button are placed at the bottom.

Here's what I need for functionality:

Conversation Flow:
    The user's input string should be sent to a REST API (/chat) when they click the "Ask Chatbot" button.
    The server should process the input and update the ConversationContext object stored in the session.
    The updated conversation context (including chatbot responses) should be dynamically
    displayed in the "Our conversation" section without refreshing the page.
    Replace "\n" with new lines.

Requirements:
    Use Thymeleaf for initial template rendering.
    Use JavaScript (preferably fetch or Axios) for submitting user input asynchronously (AJAX).
    Bind the updated conversation context returned by the REST API to the Thymeleaf template dynamically,
    updating the conversation in real-time.

Specific Features:
    When a user enters text and clicks the "Ask Chatbot" button:
    Send the input string to the /chat endpoint as a POST request.
    The server should return the updated conversation (chatbot's response and userâ€™s input).
    Update the "Our conversation" panel in real-time.
    Clear the input field after submission.

Example Flow:
    User enters "What is the capital of France?" and clicks "Ask Chatbot."
    The input is sent to /chat.
    The server responds with the chatbot's reply: "The capital of France is Paris."
    The conversation panel is updated dynamically

    Please provide the Thymeleaf template and JavaScript code needed for this integration
    with the "/chat" endpoint.
